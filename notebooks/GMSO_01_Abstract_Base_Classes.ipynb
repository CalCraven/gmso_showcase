    "# Module gmso.abc\n",
    "This module provides the abstract base classes for all other core data structures used in gmso. Our abstract base classes inherit from [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)'s `BaseModel` class which provides type hints as well as runtime data validation together with out-of-the-box serialization. The module structure is as follows:\n",

    "## Extensibility \n",
    "The implementation of abstract base classes allows for a consistent and systematic expansion of the library. The `gmso.abc` would allow new data classes to be implemented as needs arise with built-in common attributes/methods and type-check. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Implementing a Bead\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Bead` class can now be implemented as a subclass of the abstract `Site` class. We can use the existing attributes from the super class like `name`, `position` etc... and define new attributes and methods for `Bead`. The goal is the consolidation of as many universal characteristics of a generic topology site into a base class (`Site`) and tweak its down-stream usage according to the needs of a particular site (like an `Atom` or a `Bead`). Usage of `Site` to create a `Bead` class is shown below:"
